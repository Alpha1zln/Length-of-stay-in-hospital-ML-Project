IN VER 1 -------------------------
SELECTED 8 COLS IN VER 1 [AS THEY ARE SHOWN AS IMP FEATURES]

COLS VALUES ARE IN LABEL ENCODER AND SCALING FORM 

Improve - [for ver 2]
    -IN APP.PY  -> SAME LABEL ENCODER AND SCALING IS NEEDED

  
IN VER 2 ---------------------------
DONE - 
IN AP.PY - 
  MAPPING OF ACTUAL VALUES WITH LABEL ENCODER VALUES OF COLS 
  SCALING DONE on 2 cols [but little dft then act]

Improvement possible - [for ver 3]
  - few cols can be included if mapping done , can be added in model
  - few col values are unknown to public, so remove them from model, if ok
  - can we add some plot in streamlit UI
  - styling if k
  - check random forest and other models too
